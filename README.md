# 🦶 thebarefoot.dev

**Building community tools, one block at a time.**

Welcome to _thebarefoot.dev_ — a living journal of grassroots technology built for real people, in real places — starting with Detroit. This space exists to share tools, frameworks, and stories from the field, with the hope that others can build alongside, not behind.

Every repo, project, and post here is rooted in one core belief:

> "Technology, like medicine, should be in the hands of the people who need it most."
> — Inspired by the Barefoot Doctor legacy

## 🧭 What is thebarefoot.dev?

_thebarefoot.dev_ is both a personal blog and a digital lab space — inspired by the barefoot doctors of rural China who brought healthcare to underserved communities. This is an attempt to bring that same energy to software development.

It’s not about scaling startups.  
It’s about building **small, meaningful tools** that neighbors can use to support each other.

Whether it's helping local artists host better events, building decentralized ID systems, or prototyping civic apps — every project begins with a simple question:

**“How can tech help us take better care of each other?”**

## 🧱 The Framework: Barefoot Technologists

Barefoot technologists are everyday people empowered to build, teach, and maintain digital tools for their communities.

### 💡 Why We Need Them

- **Tech deserts** in underserved areas
- **Lack of digital fluency** beyond consumption
- **Imported tools** that don't fit local context
- **Centralized platforms** that extract more than they give

### 🧑‍🌾 Who They Are

- Local youth, artists, librarians, organizers, gig workers
- People already embedded in their neighborhoods
- Trusted, present, and chosen by the community

### 🎓 How They Learn

- Peer mentorship from technologists
- Hands-on clinics, build nights, and community labs
- Learn-by-doing: every learner becomes a future trainer

### 🛠 What They Build

- Mutual aid dashboards  
- Offline-first civic tools  
- Local creator marketplaces  
- Crisis response maps  
- Oral storytelling + AI archives  
- Blockchain-backed transparency for public funds

## ✨ Closing Thought

Barefoot technologists are not just developers — they're cultural translators, digital healers, and community architects. Their work spreads not through code alone, but through relationships, trust, and local knowledge.

> "Start from the people. Serve the people. Stay with the people."

If you're building something for your block, your neighborhood, your city — you're in the right place.

Let’s build it, one block at a time.
